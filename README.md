# classification-approaches
## Introduction
This is the repo for the Aalborg Machine Learning meetup, or at least to its first big topic-thread. The different projects from the meetings will be stored here, so you can download them and try them out yourselves.

The first big topic of the meetup will be Classification. A dataset will be chosen, which has several features and enough samples, and which is prepared for machine learning, however we will touch on data collection to give an idea about a full project flow.

During the meetings Jupyter notebooks will be used for simplicity. There might be different required packages between topics, however they will all be compiled into the same requirements file so any part of the project can be run after installing the packages listed in that. A more thorough installation guide for the used environment can be found at the end of this README, which will be updated as we progress with the meetings.
